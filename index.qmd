I am a Research Scientist at the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH) and Harvard Business School. I completed my PhD in Economics at The Ohio State University in 2019.

I study the economics of science and innovation. Recent work includes studying the effect of grant delays on labor market outcomes, how grant design affects the direction of research, and estimating the scientific production function.
