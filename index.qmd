I am a Staff Research Scientist at the University of Toronto, based in the Acceleration Consortium and Rotman School of Management. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow and then Research Scientist at the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH) and Harvard Business School. I completed my PhD in Economics at The Ohio State University in 2019.

I am an innovation and labor economist. Some of my recent work includes: studying how funding delays affect the labor market outcomes of the research workforce, estimating the knowledge production function to better understand the optimal distribution of resources in science.

<!-- I study innovation and knowledge production in the context of science. Recent work includes eliciting researchers' preferences and responses to grant design, studying how funding delays affect the movement of human capital across sectors and borders, and estimating the knowledge production function to better understand the optimal distribution of resources in research. -->
