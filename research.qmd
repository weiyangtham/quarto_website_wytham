## Work in Progress

### Scientific Production Function

with Jeff Qiu and Bruce Weinberg

### The Effect of Targeted Increases in Science Funding: Stem Cell Research in California

with Joseph Staudt

### The Effect of Temporary Colocation on Knowledge Flows

I study the effect of short-term, repeated interactions on knowledge flows using the setting of NIH "study sections", which are panels of grant reviewers. Using variation in how much reviewers' terms overlap, I find that the longer scientists serve together on the same panel, the more likely they are to cite each other up to 10 years after initial co-location.
